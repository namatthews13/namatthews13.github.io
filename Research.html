              <h3>Logic Locking</h3>
							<p class="indent">
								Logic locking is a technique to encrypt the circuit such that the circuit can have
                its correct function only with the correct key. Under different threat models, various kinds of logic locking techniques were developed. 
                Additionally, there must be a balance between the security level and overhead. 
                There are logic locking techniques with different bounds of overhead as required by the industry. 
                Hence, we are working on developing logic locking techniques that protect the circuit from IP theft with low overhead.

              <h3>Hack@DAC</h3>
							<p class="indent">
                To foster a security mindset and to develop the next-generation hardware security engineers, like-minded researchers have created a security competition at the Design Automation Conference (DAC). 
                Hack@DAC is a competition where teams compete to find security bugs in a given system-on-a-chip (SoC). 
                The bugs can range anywhere from the leakage of secret information to allowing an attacker to corrupt data to bring down an entire system. 
                Intel and Qualcomm have joined hands with the Hack@DAC organizers to develop an open-source SoC riddled with security bugs.
							</p>
              <p class="indent">
                There are two phases in the competition: 1) Alpha phase - before DAC, and 2) Beta phase - at DAC. 
                In the Alpha phase of the Hack@DAC 2019 competition, teams from both academia and industry compete over the course of two months to find hardware security bugs in the provided SoC design. 
                The most successful teams from Alpha Phase of Hack@DAC bring their expertise on site for Beta Phase of the contest. In Beta Phase, RTL of a new buggy SoC released to the teams in the competition room. 
                In that room, the teams compete in real time to find security bugs in the design and score as many points as possible by the time limit. At the end of 33-hour competition, prizes are given to the winning teams in the Hack@DAC award ceremony. 
                The competition concludes with a knowledge sharing session, in which 1) top-scoring teams give presentations on the techniques they successfully used to find security bugs in the SoC and 2) Organizers present competition highlights to the DAC audience.
